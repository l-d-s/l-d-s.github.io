    <p>
      I am an aspiring applied statistician and a PhD candidate in the 
      <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics">
      Department of Biostatistics</a> at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 
      advised by <a href="https://www.hansenlab.org/">Dr. Kasper Hansen</a> and 
      <a href="https://www.elizabethstuart.org/">Dr. Elizabeth Stuart</a>.

      In my dissertation I am developing methods to analyze data from genomics
      and stratified (precision) medicine.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm originally from Melbourne, Australia, where I worked in the laboratory
      of <a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/tony-papenfuss">Tony Papenfuss</a>
      after completing undergraduate and masters degrees in statistics at the 
      University of Melbourne.
    </p>

    <p>
      My broader statistical interests are in multilevel and causal models,
      the interplay of bayesian and sampling theory ideas, and effective
      statistical communication (including graphics and teaching).
