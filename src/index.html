    <p> I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow working with <a
    href="https://www.mcri.edu.au/researcher-details/katherine-lee">Prof.
    Katherine Lee</a> in the <a
    href="https://www.mcri.edu.au/research/research-areas/population-health/clinical-epidemiology-biostatistics-cebu">
    Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit </a> at the Murdoch Childrens
    Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia. </p>
    
    <p> I'm working on the design and analysis of <a
    href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41573-019-0034-3">adaptive platform
    trials</a>—clinical trials that investigate multiple interventions for a
    disease or condition, with interventions entering or leaving the study as
    evidence accrues about which ones work best. In particular I'm helping to
    design an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.14409">adaptive trial
    in pediatric sepsis</a>.</p>

    <h3>Broader research interests</h3> 
    
    <p>I'm interested helping biomedical
    scientists generate clear, compelling evidence from experiments: </p>
      
    <ul> 
      <li> More efficient experimental designs using Bayesian and decision-theoretic ideas. </li>
      <li> Going beyond subgroup analysis for understanding varying treatment effects in clinical trials. </li>
      <li> Methods for analyzing experiments in high-throughput biology. </li>
      <li> Improving statistical communication, 
        including graphics, teaching, and statistical terminology.</li>
      </ul>
    
    Other interests include
    
      <ul>
      <li> The interplay of evidence (likelihood and bayesian modelling) and
      robustness (frequentist reliability and testing; model checks).</li>
      <li> Graphical models for causality and decision-making. </li>
      <li> Reproducible research 
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giaa121">
          using Nix and related technologies.</a></li>
    </ul> 

    <h3>Background</h3>
    
    <p> I completed my PhD in the <a
    href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics"> Department
    of Biostatistics</a> at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public
    Health, advised by <a href="https://www.hansenlab.org/">Dr. Kasper
      Hansen</a> and <a href="https://www.elizabethstuart.org/">Prof. Elizabeth
        Stuart</a>. 
    <!-- </p>
    
    <p>  -->
      In my dissertation I developed methods to help tackle problems
    in molecular biology and targeted (precision) medicine. You can read it <a
    href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19weXObJs5NzlbYBdUwfMDhsX49_oC6Sv/view?usp=sharing">here</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chapter 2 proposes simple rank-based statistics for understanding the
        "overlap" among related conditions based on genomic data.</li>

    <li>Chapter 3 develops the <i>proportional interaction model</i>, a
    parsimonious model for understanding how treatment effects vary in clinical
    trials and other experiments.</li> </ul>

    I was also part of efforts to pool data from clinical trials of drugs
repurposed to treat COVID-19.
    
    <p> Before my PhD I worked in the laboratory of <a
      href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/tony-papenfuss">Dr. Tony Papenfuss</a>
      and completed undergraduate and masters degrees at the University of
      Melbourne. </p>



    <h3>Other interests</h3> 
    
    <p>Functional programming, philosophy and theology,
    classic Hollywood movies, lettering, spending time with my family.
