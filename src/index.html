      I am an applied statistician and Postdoctoral Research Fellow with
      <a href="https://www.mcri.edu.au/researcher-details/katherine-lee"
        >Prof. Katherine Lee</a
      >
      in the
      <a
        href="https://www.mcri.edu.au/research/research-areas/population-health/clinical-epidemiology-biostatistics-cebu"
      >
        Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit
      </a>
      at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia.
      (This is a personal website.)
    </p>

    <h3>Research Interests</h3>

    <p>
      I work on the design and analysis of
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41573-019-0034-3"
        >adaptive platform trials</a
      >—clinical trials that investigate multiple interventions for a given
      disease or condition, with interventions entering or leaving the study as
      evidence accrues about which ones work best. I am helping to design a
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.14409"
        >platform trial in pediatric sepsis</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      More broadly I want to help scientists generate clear, comprehensible, and
      decision-relevant evidence from biomedical experiments. I am interested in
      both clinical trials and laboratory experiments, from the planning and
      design phase, through analysis and modeling, to communicating and
      interpreting results.
    </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>

    <p>
      I completed my PhD in the
      <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics">
        Department of Biostatistics</a
      >
      at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, advised by
      <a href="https://www.hansenlab.org/">Dr. Kasper Hansen</a> and
      <a href="https://www.elizabethstuart.org/">Prof. Elizabeth Stuart</a>.
      There were two projects in
      <a
        href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19weXObJs5NzlbYBdUwfMDhsX49_oC6Sv/view?usp=sharing"
        >my dissertation</a
      >:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Chapter 2 proposes simple statistics based on sorted ranks—we call them
        <i>rank-gap statistics</i>—for understanding the “overlap” among related
        conditions based on genomic data (<a
          href="https://github.com/l-d-s/rankGap"
          >R package</a
        >).
      </li>

      <li>
        Chapter 3 studies the <i>proportional interaction model</i>, a
        parsimonious nonlinear extension of additive regression adjustment for
        modelling varying treatment effects in clinical trials and other
        experiments.
      </li>
    </ul>

    During my doctoral studies I was also part of efforts to pool data from
    clinical trials of drugs repurposed to treat COVID-19.

    <p>
      Before this I worked in the laboratory of
      <a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/tony-papenfuss"
        >Dr. Tony Papenfuss</a
      >
      (primarily in cancer genomics), and completed undergraduate and masters
      degrees at the University of Melbourne.
    </p>

    <h3>Other Interests</h3>

    <p>
      Functional programming (including reproducible research using
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giaa121"
        >Nix and related technologies</a
      >), philosophy and theology, classic Hollywood movies, fonts and
      lettering, spending time with my family.
