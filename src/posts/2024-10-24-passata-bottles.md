For a few years now I have been using a passata jar as a desktop water bottle:

Advantages compared with typical water bottles are

-   Glass mouthfeel
-   Good capacity (~700mL or 24 fl oz) (not too large to handle, incentivizes reasonable frequency of refills)
-   Easy to remove labels compared with reusing a plastic water bottle

Unfortunately after a little while the lids are not watertight.
